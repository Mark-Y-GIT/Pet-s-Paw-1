      <h2>About us</h2>
      <p>
        We are a charity project. Our goal is<strong>
          to help shelters find new owners for as many animals as
          possible.</strong
        >
        The more animals find new families, the more space is freed up for
        newcomers.

          <h3>Stray Problems</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>One saved life is already a success. </strong>The first
            thing is to stop pretending that the problem does not exist! There
            is a problem. And it’s scale is large.
          </p>

          <h3>It’s Convenient</h3>
          <p>
            We’ve collected a large database of pets from various shelters in
            Ukraine.
            <strong
              >With us you need just 5 minutes to find a pet. Just fill out the
              form and wait.</strong
            >
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Safe and Easy</h3>
          <p>
            Each animal that passed through a shelter underwent
            <strong>a full medical examination</strong>, passed all the tests
            and went through a treatment for standard diseases.
          </p>

          <h3>They Need a Family</h3>
          <p>
            They are often hungry, sharing their cages. They look at you with
            such hopeful eyes. Pets are great.
            <strong
              >Animals that got into your home from shelters are
              incredible!</strong
            >
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Why Makes a Difference</h3>
      <p>
        Taking animal from a shelter you save two lives including the one
        that’ll come to the freed space. You give this saved life a chance to
        live in love and care.
        <strong>By doing this you become a hero that inspire others.</strong>
